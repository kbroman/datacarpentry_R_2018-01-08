# Capstone project

Create and compile an R Markdown report:

1. Load the `portal_clean.csv` data.

2. Create boxplots of weight by sex.

3. Create a histogram of hindfoot lengths.

4. Create a scatterplot of hindfoot length vs weight for the species
`"DM"`, `"DO"`, and `"DS"`. _Use different colors for the three
species, and put the three species in different panels._

5. Create a line plot of the counts of `"DM"` in `"Rodent Exclosure"` plots over time.

6. Create a table of counts of `"DM"` by plot type for the year 1977.
