# Challenge 1


Make a scatterplot of `hindfoot_length` vs `weight`, but only for the
`species_id` `"DM"`.

- Use dplyr to make a dataset with just `species_id == "DM"`
- Use our ggplot2 code above but with this new dataset.


---

# Challenge 2


Use dplyr to calculate the mean `weight` and `hindfoot_length`
for each species. (Use `group_by()` and `summarize()`.)

Make a scatterplot of mean `hindfoot_length` vs mean `weight`, where
each point is a species.


---

# Challenge 3


Make a plot of counts of `species_id` `"DM"` and `"DS"` by year.


---

# Challenge 4


Try using `geom_histogram()` to make a histogram visualization of the
distribution of `weight`.

Hint: You want `weight` as the x-axis aesthetic. Try specifying `bins`
in `geom_histogram()`.


---

# Challenge 5


A variant on the box plot is the violin plot. Use `geom_violin()` to
make violin plots of `hindfoot_length` by `species_id`.


---

# Challenge 6


- Calculate counts grouped by `year`, `species_id`, and `sex`

- Make a plot of the counts by year, faceting on `species_id`

- Split by sex within each panel, using different colors for the two sexes.


---

# Challenge 7


- Create a new R Markdown document.
- Delete all of the R code chunks and write a bit of Markdown (some sections, some italicized
text, and an itemized list).
- Convert the document to a webpage.


---

# Challenge 8


Add code chunks to

- Load the ggplot2 package
- Read the portal data
- Create a plot


---

# Challenge 9


Use chunk options to control the size of a figure and to hide the
code.


---

# Challenge 10


Try out a bit of in-line R code.



# Capstone project

Create and compile an R Markdown report:

1. Load the `portal_data_joined.csv` data.

2. Create boxplots of weight by sex, _omitting individuals with
missing sex_.

3. Create a histogram of hindfoot lengths.

4. Create a scatterplot of hindfoot length vs weight for the species
`"DM"`, `"DO"`, and `"DS"`. _Use different colors for the three
species, and put the three species in different panels._

5. Create a table of counts of `"DM"` by plot type for the year 1977.

6. Create a line plot of the counts of `"DM"` in `"Rodent Exclosure"` plots over time.
